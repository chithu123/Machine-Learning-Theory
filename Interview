Livongo Mobile is the name of Livongo's mobile application, which allows users to monitor their health data and receive coaching from certified health coaches. The app includes features such as reminders to check blood glucose levels, messaging with coaches, and personalized insights and recommendations based on the user's health data.
However, it is worth noting that machine learning is a key component of Livongo's overall platform. Livongo's health coaching program uses machine learning algorithms to analyze user data and provide personalized coaching and recommendations based on their individual health needs and goals. By analyzing large amounts of user data, Livongo can identify patterns and insights that can help improve outcomes for people with chronic conditions. So while Livongo Mobile itself is not a machine learning platform, machine learning is a fundamental part of Livongo's overall approach to digital health coaching.
